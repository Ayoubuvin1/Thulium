# Thulium
 A simple esoteric programming language written in TypeScript in under 3 hours.

 I got the idea for this programming language fom a repository i found called [Jellyscript](https://github.com/nguyenphuminh/Jellyscript) and decided to learn TypeScript by creating a version of it that's even more painful and useless. And I thought the best name for this language is something tht reflects its uselessness. Thulium is the most useless element of the periodic table that is naturally occurring and that's the inspiration for the name.
